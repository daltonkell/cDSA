Core Data Structures and Algorithms in C
========================================

The data structures and algorithms implemented here are very popular
in computer science/engineering and considered very basic. They are all
implemented in the C language on Linux (x86).

Compiler:
gcc (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.12) 5.4.0 20160609


Completed:
  - Sorting
    - mergesort (array implementation, stack implementation)

  - Data Structures
    - stack
    - doubly linked list
    - queue

TODO (not exhaustive):
  - Searching
    - depth-first search
    - breadth-first search
    - binary

  - Sorting
    - quicksort
    - bubblesort

  - Trees
    - binary tree
    - quadtree (cartography applications)
    - K-D tree

  - Others:
    - hash set
    - deque
    - segmented stack (extend STK module)
